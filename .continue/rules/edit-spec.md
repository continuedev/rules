Please edit spec/index.md, or whichever referenced file includes the necessary information in order to make the change described below. But rather than directly editing the file, you need to first make a new version of that file, and then copy it over to the old one. This is just because there is currently a bug with the edit file tool using markdown. You should probably start by reading spec/index.md.
